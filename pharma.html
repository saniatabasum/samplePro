<h1 style="color: blueviolet;"><i><u>Absorption</u></i></h1> 
<p>Absorption is a process by which a material takes in a <u style="color: blue;"><b>liquid, gas, waves, or chemical</b></u>, making it part of itself. It can occur in a varity of context like <u style="color: blue;"><b>biology, chemical, and physiological.</b></u>

<h2 style="color: blueviolet;"><i><u>Distibution</u></i></h2>
<p>Distribution is a process of how a drug moves from th bloodstream of the body tissue and fluids through <u style="color: brown;"><b>blood stream, blood brain barrier, ad tissue binding. </b></u>

<h3 style="color: blueviolet;"><i><u>Metabolism</u></i></h3>
<p>Metabolism is a process of chemical changing a drug into a <u style="color: aqua;"><b>diffrent compound called metabolite and it has three phases</b>.</u>

<h4 style="color: blueviolet;"><i><u>Elimination</u></i></h4>
<p>Elimination is the removal of an administered drug rom the body. <u style="color: blue;"><b>It is accompalished by two ways</b></u>, either by excretion of an unmetabolised drug i its intact form or by metabolic biotransformtion.

<h5 style="color: blueviolet;"><i><u>Pharmacokintics</u></i></h5>
<p>Pharmacokinetics describes the four stages of <u style="color: brown;"><b>absorbtion, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the drug</b></u>.</p>
